To use the citizen portal:

1) In Web.config, replace [StorageName] and [StorageKey] by the ids of your configuration account of your OGDI DataLab solution.
2) If some references are invalid, just delete and re-add them to the project.
3) When deploying, you must configure "Identity and Access" to enable the administration panel.
